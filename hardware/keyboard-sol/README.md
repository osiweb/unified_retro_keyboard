# SOL keyboard

This keyboard replicates the keyboard on the SOL-20.

The keyboard is designed using KiCad in order to be the most useful for anybody
wishing to modify the keyboard for more specific uses, or to add to the project.

The keyset for the SOL-20 keyboard consists of the Unified Keyboard Project
classic ASCII keyset, with a special SOL-20 add-on keyset.

## Differences from the original include:

1. The original keyboard is a capacitive keyboard. This keyboard uses standard
   switches (either Cherry or Futaba).
   
1. The original keycaps have an 11 degree angled stem. It may be possible to
   find such keycaps, but I was unable to find any. It also may be possible to
   create 11 degree adapters. But this keyboard uses straight keycaps. I have
   tried both styles, and do not find a difference in typing comfort or speed,
   althought there is an aesthetic difference. There is s tiny bit of space
   between keys using straight keycaps, so an 11 degree adapter may not require
   any change to the layout.
   
1. The original uses UPPERCASE+REPEAT to reset the system. For technical
   reasons, this version uses CTRL+MODE_SELECT to RESET the system.
